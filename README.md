# Rugby Referee


A simple WatchOS app to help rugby referees track their games, inspired by the RefSix app. 


### Requirements

To open, edit and build this project you will need Xcode 13 beta 1 or newer. The app itself supports WatchOS 7.1 and newer, as well as iOS 14.1 and newer. 


### How to download

Ensure [git](https://git-scm.com) is installed on your machine. I recomment installing it with [HomeBrew](https://brew.sh), but a standalone install will work as well.

Then you should be able to either clone this repo directly with Xcode, or open terminal and clone it using

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jakcharvat/Rugby-Referee.git
```

Lastly just open the `.xcodeproj` file located in the cloned folder with Xcode and you're good to go :)
